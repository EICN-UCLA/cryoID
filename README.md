CryoID (cryoEM proteomic structure identification) is a python-based program that determines the unique identity of the protein(s) in (near-) atomic resolution cryoEM density maps from a pool of candidates. It takes CryoID two sequencial steps to get the job done, with two subprograms called get_queries and search_pool respectively. More technical details are given in a our paper.

CryoID was designed by Xiaorun Li (Lee), Chi-Min (Mimi) Ho and Mason Lai from Prof. Hong Zhou lab at UCLA, and developed by Lee.
