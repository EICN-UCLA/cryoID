## cryoID

cryoID (cryoEM map identification) is a python-based program that determines the unique identity of the protein(s) in (near-) atomic resolution cryoEM density maps from a pool of candidates. It takes cryoID two sequencial steps to get the job done, with two subprograms called get_queries and search_pool respectively. More technical details are given in a our paper.

cryoID was designed by Xiaorun Li, Chi-Min Ho and Mason Lai from Prof. Hong Zhou lab at UCLA, and built by Xiaorun. We thank Tom Terwilliger for the development of new phenix tools used in subprogram get_queries.

cryoID is an open-source software under the MIT license.
